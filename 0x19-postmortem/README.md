Issue Summary

The user registration service experienced an outage from 5:35 PM on February 26th, 2025, to 1:00 PM on February 27th, 2025 (GMT+2), lasting approximately 19.5 hours. During this period, users were unable to create new accounts successfully, encountering an error stating, “Account already exists.” The issue impacted approximately 30% of users attempting to register. The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the Python code related to user registration and database integration.

Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the Python code responsible for handling user registration and interactions with the database. The misconfiguration led to a scenario where the code incorrectly flagged new registrations as duplicates, displaying an error message: “Account already exists.”

The resolution involved updating the code to correctly handle unique user validations and ensuring proper integration with the database. After deployment, thorough testing confirmed that new accounts could be created without issues.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent future occurrences, we identified the following improvements:

Implement automated tests for user registration workflows to catch issues earlier.

Enhance error logging to provide more specific insights during failures.

Regularly review code changes affecting authentication and registration processes.

Action Items:

Add unit tests for user registration functionality.

Implement database validation checks to prevent false duplicate errors.

Improve alerting on registration errors to detect issues faster.

Conduct a code review focusing on authentication and database operations.
